        "Bio": {
            "Summary": "The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace — better known as \"Ada Lovelace\" — showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer",

        "Legacy": "Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in 'Faster Than Thought - A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work.",
